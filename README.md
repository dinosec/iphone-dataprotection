iphone-dataprotection:

iPhone Data Protection Tools cloned from https://code.google.com/p/iphone-dataprotection on January 24, 2015.

Code slightly changed for OS X Yosemite (v 10.10.x) with Xcode 6.1.x:
- "build_tools.sh": SDK references point to 10.10
- "demo_bruteforce.py" patched to obtain the three files used for the keychain-2.db in iOS 7.x

(The project reference for iphone-dataprotection in OS X El Capitan (v 10.11.x), with Xcode 7.3.x, has been removed, as the passcode bypass capabilities do not work in that versions - without doing further analysis)
